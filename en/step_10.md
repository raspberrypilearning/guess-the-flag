## Start a new round

At the moment we only have one round to play, so the game doesn't last long. Let's set up multiple rounds.

+ Create a new broadcast called 'Start the round'.

+ Move all of the code which previously ran after the green flag was clicked, so that it runs `when I receive 'Start the round'`.

+ Remove the `Set score to 0` block and place it back with the `When green flag clicked` block, followed by the new broadcast block you just created.

+ After the code where you check the answer, add another copy of the broadcast block to start a new round after an answer has been given.

+ Press the green flag to test your code. Click on a flag to play a round. You will notice that the next round does not get set up properly.

This is because we need to clear up the cloned flags we created before beginning another round.

+ Create another new broadcast called 'Clean up'.

+ Set the flag sprite to `Delete this clone` when it receives the 'Clean up' broadcast.

+ Place the block that broadcasts 'Clean up' just before you begin a new round after an answer has been given.

+ Test your code again and check that you can play multiple rounds successfully, and that your score continues to increase as you get answers correct.
