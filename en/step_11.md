## Challenge: improve the game

+ Add a fixed number of rounds and then tell the player their percentage of correct answers.

+ Store the player's high score.

[[[generic-scratch-high-score]]]

+ Add a timer for each round to force the player to give their answer quickly.

+ Add more flags to make the game more challenging.

+ If the player clicks on an incorrect flag, remove that flag and allow them another chance to click on a different flag instead of starting a next round.

+ Make the game into a two-player game where players take turns to guess, and their scores are recorded separately.
