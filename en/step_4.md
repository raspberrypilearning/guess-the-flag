## Choose random flags

We need to select six random flags from the flags list to be the possible choices in the game.

+ Create another list called `Chosen flags`. This list will store the six chosen flags.

+ Now create a variable called `Flag number`.

[[[generic-scratch-add-variable]]]

+ Add a custom block, just like you did for the `Create flags list` custom block. Call this new custom block `Choose random flag`.

+ Add code to this block to set the `Flag number` variable to a random number between 1 and the number of items in the `Flags` list. You will find that there is a special block in the Data tab for finding the number of items in a list.

Set the `Flag number` variable to a random number between 1 and the `length of the 'Flags' list`.

Here are the code blocks you'll need:

This is what your code should look like:

--- /hint ---

--- /hints ---

This block selects an item from a list, by number:

+ Combine this block with the `Flag number` variable to get the text of the randomly chosen item in the `Flags` list. Insert the item text into the `Chosen flags` list. Add this code to your custom block.

--- hint ---
`Insert` the text from the item at the `Flag number` position on the `Flags` list into the `Chosen flags` list.

Here are the code blocks you'll need:

--- /hint ---

--- /hints ---

+ Add your custom block to the code that will be run when the green flag is clicked.

+ Test that your code works by clicking the green flag several times and checking that different countries are added to the `Chosen flags` list. (If you have hidden the list, tick the box next to it to make it visible.)

You will notice that, if you press the green flag lots of times, your `Chosen flags` list quickly fills up with more than six choices.

+ Add blocks to delete all of the countries from the `Chosen flags` list before choosing six flags for the game.

--- hints ---
--- hint ---
`Delete all` of the chosen flags. `Repeat` choosing a `random flag` six times.

Here are the code blocks you'll need:

![Choose 6 flags hint](images/choose-six-flags-hint.png)
--- /hint ---

This is what your code should look like:

![Choose 6 flags solution](images/choose-six-flags-solution.png)
--- /hint ---

--- /hints ---

+ Test your code by clicking the green flag and checking that the `Chosen flags` list is filled with six countries each time.

You might notice that sometimes the same country gets chosen more than once in the list.

+ Add a block to the end of your custom block code to delete the randomly chosen `Flag number` from the `Flags` list after it has been added to the `Chosen flags` list. This will stop it from being chosen more than once.
